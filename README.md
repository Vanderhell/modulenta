Bounded indexing, representation transforms, selection, compact state and token helpers.

## Why it exists

Firmware repeatedly needs small reusable integer helpers without importing an oversized framework.

## What is included

- Portable C99-oriented implementation.
- Deterministic integer or fixed-point behavior documented at function level.
- No mandatory heap, threads or operating-system services.
- Separate translation units for selective linking.

## Quick start

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DMODULENTA_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

For a minimal integration, include only the required public header and compile the matching source unit. The library does not require the rest of PrimitiveCore.

## Documentation

| Need | Read |
|---|---|
| Choose a primitive | [Family guide](docs/FAMILY_GUIDE.md) |
| Check every function and contract | [API reference](docs/API_REFERENCE.md) |
| Reproduce tests and see validation limits | [Testing report](docs/TESTING.md) |
| Review design and dependencies | [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| See measured or pending performance data | [Performance](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) |

## At a glance

The public surface consists of 44 headers and 44 callable API entries under include/. Implementations are in src/ and tests are in tests/. State, buffers and output ownership are explicit in each header contract.

The CMake test option is MODULENTA_BUILD_TESTS. The library has no mandatory third-party dependency. Platform-specific link requirements are documented in CMake and the affected API header.

## Validation status

5/5 enabled host tests pass in checked GCC, Clang and MSVC configurations. The direct API suite exercises all 44 entries and passed on ESP32-S3 v0.2; the aggregate timing and whole-sketch size are documented with their limits in docs/PERFORMANCE.md.
See docs/TESTING.md for reproducible commands, coverage boundaries and hardware status.

Detailed overflow, rounding, invalid-input, memory-ownership and state rules are defined by the public headers and API reference. Do not infer them from the product name alone.
